Source Detection
##################################

fermipy provides several methods for source detection that can be used
to look for unmodeled sources as well as evaluate the fit quality of
the model.  These methods are

* :ref:`tsmap`: :py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.tsmap` generates a test
  statistic (TS) map for a new source centered at each spatial bin in
  the ROI.

* :ref:`tscube`: :py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.tscube`
  generates a TS map using the `gttscube` ST application.  In addition
  to generating a TS map this method can also extract a test source
  likelihood profile as a function of energy and position over the
  whole ROI.

* :ref:`residmap`: :py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.residmap`
  generates a residual map by evaluating the difference between
  smoothed data and model maps (residual) at each spatial bin in the
  ROI.

* :ref:`findsources`:
  :py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.find_sources` is an iterative
  source-finding algorithim that adds new sources to the ROI by
  looking for peaks in the TS map.

Additional information about using each of these methods is provided in
the sections below.

.. _tsmap:

TS Map
======

:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.tsmap` performs a likelihood
ratio test for an additional source at the center of each spatial bin
of the ROI.  The methodology is similar to that of the `gttsmap` ST
application but with a simplified source fitting implementation that
significantly speeds up the calculation.  For each spatial bin the
method calculates the maximum likelihood test statistic given by

.. math::

   \mathrm{TS} = 2 \sum_{k} \ln L(\mu,\theta|n_{k}) - \ln L(0,\theta|n_{k})

where the summation index *k* runs over both spatial and energy bins,
μ is the test source normalization parameter, and θ represents the
parameters of the background model.  Unlike `gttsmap`, the likelihood
fitting implementation used by
:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.tsmap` only fits for the
normalization of the test source and does not re-fit parameters of the
background model.  The properties of the test source (spectrum and
spatial morphology) are controlled with the `model` dictionary
argument.  The syntax for defining the test source properties follows
the same conventions as
:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.add_source` as illustrated in
the following examples.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Generate TS map for a power-law point source with Index=2.0
   model = {'Index' : 2.0, 'SpatialModel' : 'PointSource'}
   maps = gta.tsmap('fit1',model=model)

   # Generate TS map for a power-law point source with Index=2.0 and
   # restricting the analysis to E > 3.16 GeV
   model = {'Index' : 2.0, 'SpatialModel' : 'PointSource'}
   maps = gta.tsmap('fit1_emin35',model=model,erange=[3.5,None])

   # Generate TS maps for a power-law point source with Index=1.5, 2.0, and 2.5
   model={'SpatialModel' : 'PointSource'}
   maps = []
   for index in [1.5,2.0,2.5]:
       model['Index'] = index
       maps += [gta.tsmap('fit1',model=model)]

If running interactively, the `multithread` option can be enabled to
split the calculation across all available cores.  However it is not
recommended to use this option when running in a cluster environment.
       
.. code-block:: python
                
   maps = gta.tsmap('fit1',model=model,multithread=True)
       
:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.tsmap` returns a `maps`
dictionary containing `~fermipy.utils.Map` representations of the TS
and NPred of the best-fit test source at each position.

.. code-block:: python
   
   >>> model = {'Index' : 2.0, 'SpatialModel' : 'PointSource'}
   >>> maps = gta.tsmap('fit1',model=model)
   >>> print(maps.keys())
   [u'files', u'name', u'sqrt_ts', u'ts', u'src_dict', u'npred', u'amplitude']

The contents of the output dictionary are described in the following table.

============= ====================== =================================================================
Key           Type                   Description

                                     expressed in terms of the total model counts (Npred).

analysis working directory.  All output files are prepended with the
`prefix` argument.  Sample images for `sqrt_ts` and `npred` generated
by :py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.tsmap` are shown below.  A
colormap threshold for the `sqrt_ts` image is applied at 5 sigma with
iscontours at 2 sigma intervals (3,5,7,9, ...) indicating values above
this threshold.

.. _residmap:

Residual Map
============

:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.residmap` calculates the
residual between smoothed data and model maps.  Whereas
:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.tsmap` fits for positive
excesses with respect to the current model,
:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.residmap` is sensitive to
both positive and negative residuals and therefore can be useful for
assessing the model goodness-of-fit.  The significance of the
data/model residual at map position (*i*, *j*) is given by

.. math::

   \sigma_{ij}^2 = 2 \mathrm{sgn}(\tilde{n}_{ij} - \tilde{m}_{ij}) 
   \left(\ln L_{P}(\tilde{n}_{ij},\tilde{n}_{ij}) - \ln L_{P}(\tilde{n}_{ij},\tilde{m}_{ij})\right)

   \mathrm{with} \quad
   \tilde{m}_{ij} = (m \ast k)_{ij} \quad \tilde{n}_{ij} = (n \ast k)_{ij}
   \quad \ln L_{P}(n,m) = n\ln(m) - m

where *n* and *m* are the data and model maps and *k* is the
convolution kernel.  The spatial and spectral properties of the
convolution kernel are defined with the `model` argument.  All source
models are supported as well as a gaussian kernel (defined by setting
*SpatialModel* to *Gaussian*).  The following examples illustrate how
to run the method with different spatial kernels.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Generate residual map for a Gaussian kernel with Index=2.0 and
   # radius (R_68) of 0.3 degrees   
   model = {'Index' : 2.0, 
            'SpatialModel' : 'Gaussian', 'SpatialWidth' : 0.3 }
   maps = gta.residmap('fit1',model=model)

   # Generate residual map for a power-law point source with Index=2.0 for
   # E > 3.16 GeV
   model = {'Index' : 2.0, 'SpatialModel' : 'PointSource'}
   maps = gta.residmap('fit1_emin35',model=model,erange=[3.5,None])

   # Generate residual maps for a power-law point source with Index=1.5, 2.0, and 2.5
   model={'SpatialModel' : 'PointSource'}
   maps = []
   for index in [1.5,2.0,2.5]:
       model['Index'] = index
       maps += [gta.residmap('fit1',model=model)]

:py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.residmap` returns a `maps`
dictionary containing `~fermipy.utils.Map` representations of the
residual significance and amplitude as well as the smoothed data and
model maps.  The contents of the output dictionary are described in
the following table.

============= ====================== ======================================
Key           Type                   Description
============= ====================== ======================================
sigma         `~fermipy.utils.Map`   Residual significance in sigma.
excess        `~fermipy.utils.Map`   Residual amplitude in counts.
data          `~fermipy.utils.Map`   Smoothed counts map.
model         `~fermipy.utils.Map`   Smoothed model map.
files         dict                   File paths of the FITS image
                                     files generated by this method. 
src_dict      dict                   Source dictionary with the
                                     properties of the convolution kernel. 
============= ====================== ======================================

Maps are also written as both FITS and rendered image files to the
analysis working directory.  All output files are prepended with the
`prefix` argument.  Sample images for `sigma` and `excess` generated
by :py:meth:`~fermipy.gtanalysis.GTAnalysis.tsmap` are shown below.  A
colormap threshold for the `sigma` image is applied at both -5 and 5
sigma with iscontours at 2 sigma intervals (-5, -3, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...)
indicating values above and below this threshold.

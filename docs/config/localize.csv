``dtheta_max``	0.5	Half-width of the search region in degrees used for the first pass of the localization search.
``fix_shape``	False	Fix spectral shape parameters of the source of interest. If True then only the normalization parameter will be fit.
``free_background``	False	Leave background parameters free when performing the fit. If True then any parameters that are currently free in the model will be fit simultaneously with the source of interest.
``free_radius``	None	Free normalizations of background sources within this angular distance in degrees from the source of interest.  If None then no sources will be freed.
``make_plots``	False	Generate diagnostic plots.
``nstep``	5	Number of steps in longitude/latitude that will be taken when refining the source position.  The bounds of the scan range are set to the 99% positional uncertainty as determined from the TS map peak fit.  The total number of sampling points will be nstep**2.
``update``	True	Update the source model with the best-fit position.
``write_fits``	True	Write the output to a FITS file.
``write_npy``	True	Write the output dictionary to a numpy file.
